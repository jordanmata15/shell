# shell

A rudimentary shell built in C. The text ":Jordan's Shell:" is displayed when waiting for a command. Supports basic text parsing and execution of existing binaries in the operating system.
This shell was built while taking the operating systems course.

### Supports
- Basic environment variables 
- 255 characters per line
- 10 piped commands

### Purpose
To understand the inner workings of a shell process.

### Improvements
Refactoring the code for this shell by splitting up some of the logic would make it more modular and much easier to understand. However, the spec provided for the course expects this general structure.
